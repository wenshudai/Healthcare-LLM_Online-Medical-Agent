# Online-Medical-Agent
This is an online medical agent with a database feature that provides consultancy services. It utilizes the ChatGPT 4.0 API to offer online Q&A consultation services. 
When a patient seeks consultation, we ask for their basic information, such as name and date of birth, to check if they are already in our records. 
If it is their first consultation, we store their information and health status in the database. If they already exist in our database, we inquire about their latest symptoms, provide updated advice, and update the database accordingly.
